- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Mouna
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently deeply learning Python and JavaScript.
-  Iâ€™m always looking for Hackathon events. They easily got me enthusiastic.
-  Funfact: If I could choose any superpower, it would be the ability to speak any language.
   Normal languages and programming languages.This would allow me insights into different cultures and technologies.
-  You can reach me on my LinkedIn Account.
